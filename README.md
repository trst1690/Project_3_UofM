# Project_3_UofM
- Travis created the flask to pull the data from the NPS api and to get into a dataframe using MongoDB
- Ayan created a python file to scrub and get an idea of the actual content.  She created bar charts within and here we had planned on doing a heat map.  However we got clarification that all our code needs to be in JS and all our visuals need to be on one Dashboard.
- Ayan created JS code using a new structure for a zoom map.  This however turned challenging as it would only pull 45 of the 470 records we found.  It was also found that this would not speak well to leaflet which was being used for other visuals.
- Jo Ann created new coding in JS, however the data file pulled original had several lines in it which exceeded the length of reablity, creating a new challenge in it self.  She than created a new data.json file that was something that could be pulled in and all data was useable.
